Planning a kitchen remodel is exciting — but it can also be overwhelming. Here are five things every homeowner should think about before the first cabinet comes down.

## 1. Set a Realistic Budget

Kitchen remodels range widely in cost. A basic refresh can run $15,000–$25,000, while a full custom kitchen can exceed $80,000. Know your number before you shop.

## 2. Think About How You Use Your Kitchen

Do you cook daily? Host dinner parties? Have young kids? Your lifestyle should drive your layout choices — not just what looks good in photos.

## 3. Don't Skip the 3D Design Step

A 3D rendering will save you from costly surprises. It's much easier to move a wall on a computer than after the drywall is up.

## 4. Plan for the Disruption

You'll be without a kitchen for 4–8 weeks. Set up a temporary cooking station and mentally prepare for the chaos — it's worth it.

## 5. Choose the Right Team

Your cabinets, countertops, and flooring should ideally be coordinated by one team. It reduces miscommunication and keeps your project on schedule.
