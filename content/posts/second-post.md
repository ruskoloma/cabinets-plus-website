Choosing between quartz and granite is one of the most common decisions homeowners face when remodeling a kitchen. Here's an honest comparison.

## Granite: Natural Beauty, Unique Character

Every slab of granite is one-of-a-kind. The natural variation gives your kitchen a distinctive look you can't replicate.

**Pros:** Heat resistant, adds resale value, natural stone character.  
**Cons:** Requires sealing every 1-2 years, can crack if impacted hard.

## Quartz: Engineered for Low Maintenance

Quartz is made from crushed stone bound with resin, giving it a consistent pattern and near-zero maintenance requirements.

**Pros:** Non-porous (no sealing), stain resistant, consistent color, hundreds of options.  
**Cons:** Not heat resistant (use trivets), slightly less "natural" look.

## Our Recommendation

**For busy families:** Quartz. Easier to maintain and more forgiving of daily use.  
**For those who love natural stone:** Granite. The beauty is unmatched.

Stop by our Spokane showroom to see both in person — nothing beats seeing the real slabs side by side.
